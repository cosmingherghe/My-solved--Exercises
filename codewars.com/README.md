* Codewars is a community-created online platform to practice code challenges. They refer to these as “kata” (a term that usually denotes “a system of individual training exercises for practitioners of karate and other martial arts”). Users write kata to teach various techniques. Community members solve kata with solutions that enlighten others, and comment with constructive feedback. The leaders moderate the content and community.

* Challenges are in 20 different languages and 12 languages are currently in beta. Users can solve directly in their browsers. Kata are ranked by difficulty level. As users complete higher ranked kata, they progress through the ranks. There is also an opportunity to compare solutions with others and discuss optimal solutions or ask questions to the community. Finally, users can create their own kata based on their interests and experience levels. Then, the community members can solve and give feedback on the challenges.
