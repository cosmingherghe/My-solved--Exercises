//        (Geometry: two circles) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the center
//        coordinates and radii of two circles and determines whether the second circle is
//        inside the first or overlaps with the first, as shown in FigureÂ 3.10. (Hint: circle2 is
//        inside circle1 if the distance between the two centers 6 = |r1 - r2| and circle2
//        overlaps circle1 if the distance between the two centers <= r1 + r2.
