/*
    (The Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff classes) 
    Design a class named Person and its two subclasses named Student and Employee.
    
    Make Faculty and Staff subclasses of Employee. 
    
    A person has a name, address, phone number, and email address. 
    A student has a class status (freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior). 
        Define the status as a constant. 
        
    An employee has an office, salary, and date hired. 
???>    Use the MyDate class defined in Programming Exercise 10.14 to create an object for date hired. 
    A faculty member has office hours and a rank. 
    A staff member has a title. 
        Override the toString method in each class to display the class name and the personâ€™s name.
        
Draw the UML diagram for the classes and implement them. Write a test program
that creates a Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff, and
invokes their toString() methods.
