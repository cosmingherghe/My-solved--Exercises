(Compute greatest common divisor using recursion) The gcd(m, n) can also be defined recursively as follows:
 ■ If m % n is 0, gcd(m, n) is n.
 ■ Otherwise, gcd(m, n) is gcd(n, m % n).
Write a recursive method to find the GCD. Write a test program that prompts the user to enter two integers and displays their GCD.
